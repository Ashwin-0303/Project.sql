# Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL
 
 # Scale Model Car Company - SQL Data Analysis Project

## Overview
In this guided project, I step into the role of a data analyst at a scale model car company. Using SQL, we explore the company's sales database to answer key business questions related to inventory, customers, and marketing. By analyzing product, order, and customer data, we identify which products to prioritize, how to segment customers, and how much to spend acquiring new customers. Through hands-on practice with a real database, this project showcases my ability to use SQL to solve actual business problems.

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL
- Joins
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

- Nesting queries to extract data meeting specific criteria
- Using different types of subqueries in SQL statements
- Constructing SQL queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Writing SQL queries to scale data analysis projects

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Explore the Database Schema**  
   Understand the table structures and relationships within the database.

2. **Use Joins**  
   Combine data from multiple tables and analyze product sales.
